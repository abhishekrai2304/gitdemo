Hello welcome to SE evaluation of Git commands.
Submit the answers to the questionnaire and create a git remote repository on any of the git hosting websites,
using one of the software you have written so far. Practice the git-commands and give demo for: reporting of bugs, reporting issues,
fixing bugs, creating branches, merging repositories, git pushing, and making pull requests.

GitHub is very good for open source contributors.
